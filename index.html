  <h3>Learning Approach</h3>
  <p>The fundamental drive is the joy of learning.</p>
  <p>Developing a curriculum to learning.</p>
  <p>Project sequencing.</p>
  <p>I try to learn as much as possible about the scope of the problem I want to design through research. It is important also for me to ask the relevant people their pains to connect the right solutions.</p>
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <p> I pull together research for relevant project.</p>
  <p> Implementing a tight feedback loop.</p>

  <p>Accountability is at the core of my beliefs.</p>
  <p>80/20s at every level.</p>
